```{r}
corn_dat <- read.csv()
str(corn_dat) #make sure variables are the right type variable, e.g. factor, numeric

```

**Problem Set-up: Analysis of covariance.**
An RCB with 6 treatments (corn varieties) and four replicates was conducted. However, as spring progressed, plot conditions affected seedling emergence, which in turn changed ultimate yields. Hence, emerged plants were counted in each plot, and those counts were considered as a covariate in analysis of the final yields.


**1.** Write linear additive models for this study, with and without the covariate.

**answer**
The linear model for the design without the covariate is *Y*ijkl=*U*+model componetns+*E*ijkl. 
*Y*ijlk is the 
*U* is the  
the ___ factor effect per level 
the ___  factor effect per level  
the *E* experimental error.

```{r}

str(corn_dat)
corn_lm.cov <- lm() #Plants as covariate
corn_cov.aov <- aov() #Plants as covariate
corn_cov.anova <- anova()
summary()

# Run the model with no covariate
corn_lm <- lm() #No covariate
corn.aov <- aov()#No covariate
corn.anova <- anova()
  

  
```


**2.** Conduct an initial ANOVA of yields without covariate noting sources of variation, degrees of freedom, and use an LSD to compare yields among varieties. Conduct a parallel analysis of plants. 
```{r}

corn.anova <- aov() #create anova object for yeilds
plants.anova <- aov() #create anova object for plants 
corn.lsd <- LSD.test() #mean seperation for anova without covariate
plants.lsd <- LSD.test() #mean seperation for anova for plants




```

**4.** Graphically examine the relationship between the covariate and the treatments
```{r}
ggplot(data=,mapping=aes(x=,y=,group=,col=)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

**5.** Conduct a formal ANCOVA of yields, using plants as a covariate.
```{r}
corn_cov.anova <- aov() #plants will be the covariate
```

6. Conduct a mean separation based on ANCOVA adjusted means. 
```{r}

corn_cov.lsd <- LSD.test()

bar.group()
title(main="", xlab="",ylab="")

```


7. Based on your analysis, write a paragraph explaining the biological findings of the study, and explain why conclusions of the two analyses differed.
