# TPSS 603 - Experimental Design
## Split-Plot Combining Experiments 
### Name

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(raster)
library(lattice)
library(agricolae)
```

**Problem Background**
We are exploring a dataset of Alfalfa yield trials designed to compare the performance of 5 entries (varieties) of alfalfa in three different locations (environments). This problem set focuses on one important performance trait: crude protein content, in g per kg leaf dry matter (LeafCP) at time of harvest.  The five varieties were grown in 4 replicate plots (blocks) at each of three locations. Location 1 = North, 2 = South, and 3 = South-East. Your overall task is to analyze the results and extract recommendations about the relative leaf protein contents of the different varieties in the different locations.
**Information**
Whole Plot is Loc column.
Split Plot is Entry column.
Block is Rep column.
```{r}
alfalfa <- read.csv('path to file')

str(alfalfa) # what are factors what are numeric, is everything as it should be?
summary(alfalfa)

```

```{r}
library(lattice)
dotplot()
```

### Summary by Treatment
```{r}
library (dplyr)
library(raster)
alf_stats <- 
  alfalfa %>% 
  group_by() %>% # <- remember to group by the important factor/s
  summarise(Means = mean(), SE = sd()/sqrt(n()), 
            CV = cv()) #calculate statistic for variable of interest
alf_stats
```


1.	Write the linear additive model for a single location, and then do the same for the locations combined (write the linear additive model for a RCBD and a split plot)
**Answer:** 

2.	Construct an appropriate ANOVA table, showing sources, dfs, and appropriate F-tests.
```{r}
alf_aov <- aov()

summary(alf_aov)
```


3.	Present results in tables or graphs, as appropriate, to justify your decision to combine the three experiments into one analysis, and to support your conclusions about the performances of the entries in the different locations.
```{r}
alf_assum<-aov()
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(alf_assum)
```

```{r}
#use agricoale to do the analysis
model<-with(alfalfa,sp.plot()) # calulate correct split plot with agricolae

#create correct error terms
gla<-model$gl.a #degrees of freedom for error A
glb<-model$gl.b #degrees of freedom for error B
Ea<-model$Ea # Mean sq. error A
Eb<-model$Eb # Mean sq. error B

```

### Mean Comparison of Main Plot Factor
```{r}

whole_p <- with(alfalfa,LSD.test()) #calculate whole plot mean comparision using LSD.test

```

### Mean Comparison of Sub-Plot Factor
```{r}
sub_p <- with(alfalfa,LSD.test()) #calculate split plot mean comparision using LSD.test
```

### Mean Comparison of Interaction
```{r}
interaction_p <- with(alfalfa,LSD.test()) #calculate interaction mean comparision using LSD.test
```


4.	Based on results of your analysis, prepare a summary graph or table, and write an accompanying paragraph that would explain your conclusions to a non-expert.

### Sub-Plot Factor Bar Graph
```{r}
bar.group() #create sub-plotLSD graph
```


### Interaction Factor Bar Graph
```{r}
bar.group()#create interaction LSD graph
```
