```{r}
exercise_dat <- read.csv("",header=TRUE)
str(exercise_dat)

```
**Problem Set-up:**
The data here consist of people who were randomly assigned to two different diets: low-fat and not low-fat and three different types of exercise: rest, walking leisurely and running. Their pulse rate was measured at three different time points during their assigned exercise: at 1 minute, 15 minutes and 30 minutes.

**1.**
Graph the change in pulse over time by diet at the different exercise treatments. What do the patterns suggest?
**Answer:**

```{r}
###dot plot
with(exercise_dat,plot(x=,y=,col=))

#boxplot
ggplot(data=, aes(x=, y=, shape=, fill=))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(position=position_dodge(0.8), size =3) +
  theme_bw()

#line plot
ggplot(data=,aes(x=,y=, group=, colour=))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +
  facet_grid(.~)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Two diets over time",y="Pulse",title="Pulse over time by diet and exertype")
```


**2.**
Now analyze the data as mixed effects. Show results of your analysis. Discuss what your analysis suggests about the patterns seen in part 1.
**Answer:**


```{r}

###model to determine  the autocorrelation between timepoints
exercise_cor <- lme( ~  +  +  + , 
              random = ~1|,
              data=exercise_dat)

#correlation for lags
ACF(exercise_cor)

anova(exercise_cor)
r.squaredGLMM(exercise_cor)

#model for analysis accounting for correlation
model <- gls( ~ +  + ,
            correlation = corAR1(form = ~  | ,
            value = ), 
            data=exercise_dat,
            method="REML")
summary(model)
coef(summary(model))
rsquared(model)


marginal <- emmeans(model, ~ ) #ls means comparisons your intersted in
pairs(marginal, alpha = 0.05, Letters = letters, ### Use lower-case letters for .group
 adjust = "tukey") ### Tukey-adjusted comparisons

#Create a new object to plot
Sum <- groupwiseMean( ~  + , data = exercise_dat,conf = 0.95, digits = 3, traditional = FALSE, percentile = TRUE)

head(Sum)

#plot the values 
ggplot(data=Sum, aes(x = ,y = , color = )) +
geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=Percentile.lower,ymax=Percentile.upper), width=.2, size=0.7, position=position_dodge(0.8)) +
geom_point(shape=15, size=4, position=position_dodge(0.8)) +
theme_bw() +
theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
ylab("Pulse")
