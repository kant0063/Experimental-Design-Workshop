# TPSS 603 - Experimental Design
### Name

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

#libraries needed for the homework
library(daewr)
library(gmodels)
library(dplyr)
library(raster)
library(agricolae)
library(ggplot2)

```

**1.	Create a potential randomization for any CR data.**
```{r}

#create a randomization based on a function from a library
#hint use ?design.crd
#reacall 5 treatmants 30 replications per treatment
design.crd() #function from agricolae that will do the randomization

```

**Load in the Fertilizer data**

```{r}
#this is where you use the data from the file attached
data <- read.csv("") #read in the datafile
head(data) #look at the first 6 lines of the data

#create the anova model for the design using the data provided

mod <- aov("CR design model", data=data) #create a linear model for the data
summary(mod) #look at the anova for the model

```

**2.	What is the Null Hypothesis?**
**Answer:** 

**3.	What is the Alternative hypothesis?**
**Answer:** 

**4.	What is the Linear model?** # this is the abstraction of the generalized model

**Answer:** 

**5.	What is the experimental unit?** 
**Answer:** 

**6.	What are the treatments?**
**Answer:** 

**7.	How many factors are being studied?**
**Answer:** 

**8.	How many levels are present?**
**Answer:** 

**9.	Is the normality assumption true (qqplot)?**
**Answer:**  
```{r}

par(mfrow=c(2,2)) #set the plot
plot(mod) #use the plot funciton to make the qq plot

```

**10.	Complete the ANOVA table for the experiment.**
```{r}

summary() #Print the summary of the anova table from the model abve

```

**11.	Do we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?**
**Answer:**  

**12.	Construct a contrast between two treatments and interpret the result.**
**Answer:** 
```{r}

mod # look at linear model
summary(mod) # look at the summary of the model
fit.contrast(mod,"Trt", c()) # create the contrast between two treatments



```
**Answer:**
