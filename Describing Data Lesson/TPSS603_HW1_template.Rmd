# Name - HW1 - Experimental Design


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(maptools)
library(ggplot2)
library(raster)
library(psych)
library(gmodels)
library(Rmisc)

```

## 1.	Import the data
```{r}
df <- read.csv("path to data file")
```

## 2. Identify a numeric variable from the dataset:
**a. Find the mean, median, variance (s2), standard deviation (sd), coefficient of variation (CV) and the standard error of the mean.**
```{r}
mean("variable") #calculating mean on variable of interest
median("variable") #calculating median on variable of interest
var("variable") #calculating variance if variable of interest
sd("variable") #calculating standard deviation of variable of interest
(sd("variable")/mean("variable"))*100 #calculating coefficient of variation = standard deviation divided by mean times 100
(sd("variable")/sqrt(length("variable"))) #calculating standard error of the mean = standard deviation divided by square root

```

```{r}

#library(psych)
describe("variable",type=2) #calculating all above measures with single command

```

**b.	Split the dataset by treatment and recalculate descriptive statistics by treatment.**	
```{r}

treatment1 <- filter(df,Trt=="cotton") #Pull out the first treatment of the df
mean() #calculating mean
median() #calculating median
var() #calculating variance
sd() #calculating standard deviation
(sd()/mean())*100 #calculating coefficient of variation = standard deviation divided by mean times 100
(sd()/sqrt(length())) #calculating standard error of the mean = standard deviation divided by square root

treatment2 <- filter(df,Trt=="polyester") #pull out the first treatment of the df
mean() #calculating mean
median() #calculating median
var() #calculating variance
sd() #calculating standard deviation
(sd()/mean())*100 #calculating coefficient of variation = standard deviation divided by mean times 100
(sd()/sqrt(length())) #calculating standard error of the mean = standard deviation divided by square root

```

**Mutating Data**
```{r}
df.4 <- df %>%  #use dplyr to multipe the variable of choice by 4
  summarize("variable"*4) %>% 
  mutate()

df.15 <- df %>% #use dplyr to add 15 to the variable of choice
  summarize("variable"+15) %>% 
  mutate()

df.all <- cbind(df,df.15, df.4)#combine all modified variables into a single dataframe
```
**c.	Find the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation, and standard error of the mean for the same variable after you add 15 to each data value.**
```{r}

mean() #calculating mean
median() #calculating median
var() #calculating variance
sd() #calculating standard deviation
(sd()/mean())*100 #calculating coefficient of variation = standard deviation divided by mean times 100
(sd()/sqrt(length())) #calculating standard error of the mean = standard deviation divided by square root

```
**d.	Repeat, but this time multiply each data value by 4.** 
```{r}


mean() #calculating mean
median() #calculating median
var() #calculating variance
sd() #calculating standard deviation
(sd()/mean())*100 #calculating coefficient of variation = standard deviation divided by mean times 100
(sd()/sqrt(length())) #calculating standard error of the mean = standard deviation divided by square root

```

**e.	Describe what happens when you transform the data.**

**Answer:** 

**f.	Create a graphic of the distribution of the original and both transformed datasets on the same plot.**
```{r}

ggplot(df,mapping=aes(Trt)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y="variable"),color="red") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y="variable"+15),color="green") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y="variable"*4),color="blue") +
  labs(title="Original and Transformed Datasets",x="Treatment",y="Thread")

graph<- df.all %>%  #create new dataframe to make plotting easier
  gather(category,Trt)

ggplot(graph,mapping=aes(x=Trt,fill=category)) +
  geom_density(alpha=.2) +
  labs(title="Density Distributions of Sewing Thread and Transformed",x="Thread",y="Density")
  

```

## 3.	Construct a 95% and a 99% confidence interval for each treatment in the untransformed data
```{r}

ci95.trt1 <- ci("variable from treatment 1",confidence=.95) #calculating confidence interval 95% for treatment 1
ci95.trt2 <- ci("variable from treatment 2",confidence=.95) #calculating confidence interval 95% for treatment 2

ci99.trt1 <- ci("variable from treatment 1",confidence=.99) #calculating confidence interval 99% for treatment 1
ci99.trt2 <- ci("variable from treatment 2",confidence=.99)#calculating confidence interval 99% for treatment 2

```

## 4.	Create a graphical representation of your Confidence interval
**a.	As a histogram**
```{r}

summary99 <- summarySE(df,measurevar='variable',groupvars='Trt',conf.interval = 0.99) #create summary of variable

ggplot(summary99,aes(x=Trt,y="response")) + 
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin="response"-ci,   
                    ymax="response"+ci),width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9)) +
  labs(title="99% CI")
  

summary95 <- summarySE(df,measurevar="response",groupvars='Trt') #create summary of variable

ggplot(summary95,aes(x=Trt,y="response")) + 
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(),stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin="response"-ci,
                    ymax="response"+ci),width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9)) +
  labs(title="95% CI")

```

**b.	As a boxplot**
```{r}
ci.box <- as.data.frame(cbind(ci95.trt1,ci99.trt1,ci95.trt2,ci99.trt2))

boxplot(ci.box)
```

## 5.	How would the population represented and reliability of your answer be affected if the sample was not random, but rather was selected:

**a.	By an expert in the field?**

**Answer:**

**b.	From seven individuals in one randomly selected group?**

**Answer:** 

**c.	From the seven individuals used in a previous experiment?**

**Answer:**
